Soon after he got his own place from money he received from his Uncle Alfred (below). He was in Gryffindor house, unlike most of the other blacks. He was best friends with James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew while at school, creating the marauder’s map with them. He was then sent to Azkaban (after graduating) for supposedly telling Voldemort where James, Lily, and Harry Potter were (Even though he is Harry’s godfather). He broke out 12 years later and was supposedly after Harry. He turned out not to be bad, and Harry loved him like a father and a brother. He died in Book 5 after being killed by his first cousin Belatrix Lestrange.\n"

They started selling things at Hogwarts; such as ways to get out of class and other practical jokes. They were also the beaters on the Gryffindor quidditch team from Books 1 through 5 (they were thrown off in Book 5 by Umbridge). After they leave Hogwarts (literally leave- jumped on their broomsticks and flew away because they hated Umbridge) they started their joke shop with the money that Harry Potter gave them (1,000 galleons- his winnings from the Triwizard Tournament). They called their joke shop Weasley Wizard Wheezes. Their joke shop seems to be doing really well in Book 6, although all the things from their shop are banned at Hogwarts. It is unknown if they joined the Order of the Phoenix after they left Hogwarts. Their birthday is April 1st, April fools day. They used to live at the Burrow, but now live in a flat above their joke shop. George lost an ear in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Fred was killed in the final battle.\n",
